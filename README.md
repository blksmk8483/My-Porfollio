# # Module 2 Challenge - Advanced CSS Portfolio
-01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description
- In this challenge I prepared a site from the beginning using HTML and CSS.
- For the HTML, I spent time with the syntax to make sure I have everthing nested the way I want.
- In CSS I focused on using the flexbox model to achieve the look of my page in all sizes.

- In the future of this particular project I hope to have all my images within the work section the same size. 
- As well, I want the work box images to have a hover effect like the example given to us.

- Finally, in my future projects I want to dive deeper into my README file and what I can add there.
